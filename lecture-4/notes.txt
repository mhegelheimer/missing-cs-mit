Title: Data Wrangling

Intro
  Basic idea is taking data in one format and transforming it into a
  different format.  Examples: converting images, text/log file into
  graph/statistics, etc.

  In order to do any data wrangling you need a data source (many good
  candidates for data to perform operation on).  Examples in lecture
  notes exercise section.

  Use the following to execute those pieces on the remote server
  $ ssh tsp '<commands>'


sed (stream editor)
  - allows you to make changes to the contents of a stream
  - full programming language over the stream
  - common: run replacement expressions on an input stream

  Example sed expression:
  s                     - substitute expression
  'Disconnected from'   - search string
  ''                    - replacement string
  $ cat ssh.log | sed 's/. *Disconnected from//' | less


Regular Expressions ('disconnected from' piece in example above)

  Summary
    a very powerful way to match text
    provides a number of characters to match a type of characters

    .     - any single character
    *     - 0 or more of that character
    +     - 1 or more of that character
    []    - match one of many different characters
    ?     - 0 or 1 of a character e.g. --> (invalid )?


    Example(s)

      # replace any character that is either 'a' or 'b' with nothing
      # by default, match the pattern and apply the replacement once (sed)
      # 'g' modifier does this for every time it matches

      $ echo 'aba' | sed 's/[ab]//'
      ba
      $ echo 'bba' | sed 's/[ab]//'
      ba
      $ echo 'bcbzac' | sed 's/[ab]//g'
      czc


      # 0 or more of string 'ab' and replace with nothing
      # -E (allows support for modern version of regex - can also use
            backslashes for parenthesis)

      $ echo 'abcaba' | sed -E 's/(ab)*//g'
      ca


      # replace that matches 'ab' or 'bc' with nothing

      $ echo 'abcababc' | sed -E 's/(ab|bc)*//g'
      cc
      $ echo 'abcabbc' | sed -E 's/(ab|bc)*//g'
      c


      # .* is greedy and will match as many as they can

      $ echo 'Disconnected from invalid user Disconnected from 84.211' | sed 's/.*Disconnected from//'
      84.211


    Parsing the log file
      # sample lines
      'Jan 11 00:00:00 notawebsite.com sshd[20047]: Disconnected from user notch 24.61.9.143 port 52896'
      'Jan 11 00:00:00 notawebsite.com sshd[20047]: Disconnected from invalid user botch 24.61.9.143 port 52896'
      'Jan 11 00:00:00 notawebsite.com sshd[20047]: Disconnected from invalid user admin 24.61.9.143 port 52896 [preauth]'
      'Jan 11 00:00:00 notawebsite.com sshd[20047]: Disconnected from authenticating user root 24.61.9.143 port 52896 [preauth]'

      # (invalid )?     - o or 1 of 'invalid '
      # .*              - some username
      # [0-9.]+         - comprises ip addresses, using range syntax ('+ means many of those')
      # [0-9]+          - comprises port
      # the following are called 'anchoring' (necessary in the case that username is entire log string)
      # ^               - carrot/hat matches beginning of line
      # $               - dollar sign matches end of line

      # initial
      $ cat ssh.log | sed -E 's/^.*Disconnected from (invalid )?user .* [0-9.]+ port [0-9]+$//'

      # account for 3rd & 4th cases
      $ cat ssh.log | sed -E 's/^.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user .* [0-9.]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$//'


      q: How do we remember the username (for example)
      a: Using regex capture groups --> any parenthesis expression


      # use capture group to retain 'username' values
      # \2      - refer to 2nd capture group
      $ cat ssh.log | sed -E 's/^.*Disconnected from (invalid |authenticating )?user (.*) [0-9.]+ port [0-9]+( \[preauth\])?$/\2/'



This ^ is was a very complicated regular expression.

In these situations, regular expression debuggers come in handy (e.g. regex101.com)
