Random thought before lecture started - how to show linux command history
  $ history | tail -[number of lines]

Bash Basics

Be very careful with spaces (separate arguments to a command)
Example
  $ foo=bar
  $ echo $foo
  bar
  $ foo = bar
  zsh: command not found: foo

Strings in bash
  - can use double quotes or single quotes
  - not equivalent outside of string literals
Example
 $ echo  "Value is $foo"
 Value is bar
 $ echo 'Value is $foo'
 Value is $foo

Ability to define functions, control flow, etc.

Example Bash Script
$ vim mcd.sh
mcd (){
    mkdir -p "$1"
    cd "$1"
}
$ source mcd.sh
$ mcd test
/test $ ...

RESERVED
$0      - name of script
$1-9    - first through ninth arguments
$?      - error code from previous command
$_      - last argument of the previous command
!!      - 'bang bang' (previous command)

Random
||      - execute first, if that doesn't work, execute second.
$ false || echo "Oops fail"
Oops fail
$ true || echo "Oops fail"
$

&&      - only execute second part if first one runs w/o errors.
$ true && echo "Things went well"
Things went well
$ false && echo "No print"
$

;       - will always print (concat to first regardless if error)
$ false ; echo "This will always print"
This will always print



How do you get the output of a command into a variable?
$ foo=$(pwd)

Common Substitution
$ echo "We are in $(pwd)"
We are in /Users/michaelhegelheimer/_projects/missing-mit/lecture-2

Process Substitution
notes: put ls into temporary file(s) and concat together
$ cat <(ls) <(ls ..)


See example.sh


q: Is there a way to give arguments more succinctly?
a: Globbing

# match any sort of characters that end up with '.sh'
$ ls *.sh

# ? represents on ly a single character
$ ls project?.old

Globbing can be very powerful - for example by combining
$ convert image.png image.jpg
or
# expands the line
$ convert image.{png, jpg}

$ touch foo{,1,3,10}
becomes
$ touch foo foo1 foo2 foo10

$ cp project{1,2
$ project{1,2}/src/test/test{1,2,3}.py
expands to (cartesian product of these 2 expansions)
$ project1/src/test/test1.py project1/src/test/test2.py ...

$ mkdir foo bar
$ touch {foo,bar}/{a..j}

# create difference in the folders
$ touch foo/x bar/y

# use of earlier command to identify differences
# 'x' is only in first folder
# 'y' is only in second folder
$ difdf <(ls foo) <(ls bar)
11c11
< x
---
> y


See 'script.py'


Note: bash is not modern and was developed a while ago.  sometime it is
      hard to debug.

# can be installed with HomeBrew
$ shellcheck <bashscript>.sh

When writing bash scripts or functions, there is a difference in writing them
in isolation and as something that'll be loaded into your shell.

** The man command

tldr, convert, ffmpeg

Recommended installs: rg, tldr, fd

random question: zip vs tar


Finding files:
  Instead of ls'ing

  # find  <-- program
  # .     <-- current folder
  # -name <-- fname is src
  # -type <-- type is directory
  $ find . -name src -type d

  # find  <-- program
  # -path <-- ** some number of folders, *.py all python scripts
  # -type <-- file
  $ find . -path '**/test/*.py' -type f

  # find   <-- program
  # -mtime <-- modified time (modified in the last day)
  $ find . -mtime -1

The 'find' program can also do things on top of finding stuff
  $ find . -name "*.tmp"
  ./test2.tmp
  ./test3.tmp
  ./test1.tmp'

  # remove all .tmp files in current directory
  $ find . -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;


Note: if you perform a lot of "find"s a day, build an index using DB
      and update

# not initiated by default in OSX Catalina
$ locate


Grep examples
  $ grep foobar example.sh

  # grep recursive
  $ grep -R foobar .

More
  # where i use request library in the 'grandparent' folder
  $ rg "import requests" -t py ../..
