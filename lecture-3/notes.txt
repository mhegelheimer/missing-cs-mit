Title: Editors (vim)

Overview
  - teach core philosophies of vim
  - basics (open file, close file, make edits, etc.)

Main Ideas
  1. Vim is a Modal Editor (has multiple operating modes)
    - This comes from the concept that when you're programming you're performing
    different functions (editing small, big dump, reading, etc.)
    - When you start vim up it starts in 'normal' mode
    - There are different key combinations that switch you between modes
    - spend most of time between Normal and Insert Mode
      - normal --> insert, press i
      - insert --> normal, press esc
    - Notations
      -  Control + V written as '^V', 'Ctrl-V' or '<C-V>'

  VIM MODES
    normal        - base
    insert        - i
    replace       - R
    visual        - v
    visual line   - shift+v
    visual block  - ctrl+v
    command line  - :

    - from any mode back to normal mode use 'esc' key
    - [done] typically re-bind 'Caps Lock' to 'esc' (more convenient)


  2. Using the mouse is inefficient
    ':' activates command line mode

    Useful Vim CLI Commands
      :q/quit
      :w
      :help <keystroke/command>

  3. Buffers vs Windows vs Tabs
    Vim's model of these is a bit different than other programs

    'Buffers'   <--
    'Tabs'      <--
    'Windows'   <--

    Differences:
      - not a 1-to-1 co

    Random Commands
      :sp       <-- another buffer of same file
      :tabnew   <-- new tab


  4. Vim's interface itself IS A Programming Language
